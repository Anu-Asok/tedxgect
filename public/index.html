      TED is a nonprofit organization devoted to Ideas Worth Spreading. Started as a four-day conference in California 30 years ago, TED has grown to support its mission with multiple initiatives. The two annual TED Conferences invite the world's leading thinkers and doers to speak for 18 minutes or less. Many of these talks are then made available, free, at TED.com. TED speakers have included Bill Gates, Jane Goodall, Elizabeth Gilbert, Sir Richard Branson, Nandan Nilekani, Philippe Starck, Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, Sal Khan and Daniel Kahneman.

The annual TED Conference takes place each spring in Vancouver, British Columbia. TED's media initiatives include TED.com, where new TED Talks are posted daily; the Open Translation Project, which provides subtitles and interactive transcripts as well as translations from volunteers worldwide; the educational initiative TED-Ed. TED has established the annual TED Prize, where exceptional individuals with a wish to change the world get help translating their wishes into action; TEDx, which supports individuals or groups in hosting local, self- organized TED-style events around the world, and the TED Fellows program, helping world-changing innovators from around the globe to amplify the impact of their remarkable projects and activities.

            <p>Tony Joseph is the architect behind South India’s tallest apartment tower, the forty-storey Choice Paradise. He is an elite level architect who has been at the helm of many other renowned projects such as the Kumarakom Lake Resort in Kottayam, the Capternay Resort in Seychelles and the Madhuban Resort in Gujarat. It was in the '80s that he first decided to pursue architecture as his career, finding in it a unique confluence of science and art. He did his B.Arch from MIT Manipal and went on to do his M.Arch from the University of Texas, Austin. He worked in America for a few more years, gaining valuable experience from the likes of Charles Moore and Patrick Monteiro. Moore in particular shaped his ideology and thinking.
He returned in 1989 to establish his own architectural firm in India, called STAPATI in Calicut. The firm went on to revolutionise the architectural landscape in the country, introducing new types of designs that merged seamlessly with its natural surroundings. This stems from Tony’s own philosophy, wherein he believes that humans cannot hope to surpass nature’s pristine beauty, but simply improvise upon it. All his designs have a strong traditional base, but with a modern twist.
Ar. Tony is indeed a pioneer in the field of modern Indian architecture. Come listen to his ideas and his message at TEDxGECT.

            <p>P M Atul aka Munna has practically been a musician since childhood. He gained immense popularity in 2014 when he released a music video by the name "Enikku Oru Koppum Illa" which damned social commentary on the downtrodden in our society.
He has his hand in many a musical venture, namely Shanka Tribe, a musical group that has been performing incredibly surreal music that expands our senses beyond imagination and leads us into a world that we never knew existed before. They've performed at NIT Ragam, Strawberry Fields Bangalore etc.
The effect that aesthetic music has on our soul is unprecedented and as a performer, Munna along with his friend have been performing the Hang Drum under the name HangEssence for quite a while now.
If you wish to feel the euphoria of the soft, heavenly taps upon a massive alienistic instrument; be prepared, for you'll truly explore the depths of reality as Munna lights up the insides of your being

            <p>From Westeros to Oz, from Asgard to Pandora, we've all been fascinated and at times addicted to mythical, fictional worlds and have always wondered how they were created. The sheer perfection with which they have been portrayed never cease​ to amaze us.

The world of Halahala, is one among a million such worlds, yet it is one in a million. It speaks of different ideas, but the creator, George Mathen a.k.a 'Appupen' , says he consciously​ leaves out text. His book, 'Moonward' became a huge hit and his other books, 'Legends of Halahala' and 'Aspyrus' followed suit.

"Just like being smart at writing, you can be smart in pictures. You know at the back of your mind what it could or could not be and if you trust your reading of the book, the ideas in the back of your mind take shape and come across.”- he says.

But he is, in no way an 'Appupen' in real life. He has his hands full with advertising, activism, animation and even in the film industry. He is the founding member and drummer of the Bangalore-based band, 'Lounge Piranhas'.

There is no limit to George Mathen's artistic horizons, both in terms of style, and canvas. TEDxGECT is proud to announce 'Appupen' as one of our keynote speakers</p>
